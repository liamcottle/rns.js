# RNS Web Client

This is an in progress web client for Reticulum.

Currently, it just connects to an existing [WebsocketServerInterface](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat/blob/e6ff5097c07fe09e90a392acb516f033b2a637de/src/backend/interfaces/WebsocketServerInterface.py), and displays all `lxmf.delivery` announces it receives.

One day it may do something more useful :)
